# KnightQuest

This project is a small game written in C++ and SDL 2.
It uses a controller or a keyboard to move a rendered character sprite across the screen.

To start the game, download everything in the Release folder and be sure all those files are in the same folder on your computer.
Then, double click the .exe. If using a controller, be sure to have it plugged in before starting the game.

All code is by Kevin Rogers and all artwork is by David Douglas.
